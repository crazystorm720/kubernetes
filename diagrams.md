Great! For representing containers, networks, and infrastructure with logic and layers of abstraction, we can use both Mermaid and Draw.io to create comprehensive and clear diagrams. Here are some detailed examples and instructions for each tool.

### Mermaid Diagrams

#### Container and Network Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Infrastructure
        A[Load Balancer] --> B[Web Server]
        B --> C[Application Server]
        C --> D[Database]
    end

    subgraph Containers
        E[Frontend Container] --> F[Backend Container]
        F --> G[Database Container]
    end

    subgraph Network
        A --> H[Switch]
        H --> I[Router]
        I --> J[Firewall]
    end
```

#### Layered Abstraction Diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Presentation Layer
        A[User Interface]
    end

    subgraph Application Layer
        B[Business Logic]
        C[API Gateway]
    end

    subgraph Data Layer
        D[Database]
        E[Data Warehouse]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
```

### Draw.io (diagrams.net)

#### Creating the Diagram

1. **Open Draw.io** and create a new diagram.
2. **Choose a template** or start with a blank diagram.
3. **Use the shapes panel** on the left to drag and drop elements to represent different components.

#### Example Steps

1. **Add Shapes for Containers**:
   - Use rectangular shapes to represent containers.
   - Label each shape (e.g., "Frontend Container", "Backend Container").

2. **Add Shapes for Network Components**:
   - Use different shapes for network components like switches, routers, and firewalls.
   - Connect these shapes using lines to represent network connections.

3. **Add Layers of Abstraction**:
   - Group related components together and use container shapes to represent different layers.
   - Label each layer (e.g., "Presentation Layer", "Application Layer", "Data Layer").

4. **Connect Components**:
   - Use arrows to show the flow of data between different components.
   - Use different colors or styles to differentiate between layers and types of connections.

### Example Draw.io Diagram

Here’s a more specific step-by-step guide for creating a layered infrastructure diagram:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Add a rectangle and label it "User Interface".
   - Place it at the top of the diagram.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Add two rectangles below the presentation layer, labeled "Business Logic" and "API Gateway".
   - Group them together using a larger rectangle labeled "Application Layer".

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Add two rectangles below the application layer, labeled "Database" and "Data Warehouse".
   - Group them together using a larger rectangle labeled "Data Layer".

4. **Connections**:
   - Draw arrows from "User Interface" to "Business Logic".
   - Draw arrows from "Business Logic" to "API Gateway".
   - Draw arrows from "API Gateway" to "Database".
   - Draw arrows from "Database" to "Data Warehouse".

By following these steps, you’ll have a clear and organized diagram representing containers, networks, and infrastructure with layers of abstraction.

### Tips for Effective Diagrams

1. **Consistency**: Keep your shapes and styles consistent to avoid confusion.
2. **Labels**: Clearly label each component and connection.
3. **Colors**: Use colors to differentiate between layers or types of components.
4. **Grouping**: Use grouping to show related components and layers.
